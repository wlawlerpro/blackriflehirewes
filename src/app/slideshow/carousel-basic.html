        In 2017, Wes would be let go from his position at Texas A&M.
       Wes immediately thought it would be a good idea to pick up a hard skill and chose computer programming. 
       It was at this time that a friend of Wes’s would introduce him to the typescript coding language and 
       the Angular programming frame work. Wes’s plan was to remain in Texas, get a new full time job, and 
       learn this new technology. Wes failed in his plan, but did not give up learning typescript and Angular.
        Wes would end up having to move back home with his parents in 2018.

        Today, Wes lives with his parents and loads packages for UPS.
         At the start of the pandemic, Wes saw that applying online for
          jobs was going to be a near fruitless endeavor. So he focused almost all
           of his time towards computer programming and graphic design.
