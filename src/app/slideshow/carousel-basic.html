           Wes and his three other family members. He would scrap everything off his resume just to be able to get a

       Wes immediately thought it would be a good idea to pick up a hard skill and chose computer programming. 
       It was at this time that a friend of Wes’s would introduce him to the typescript coding language and 
       the Angular programming frame work. Wes’s plan was to remain in Texas, get a new full time job, and 
       learn this new technology. Wes failed in his plan, but did not give up learning typescript and Angular.
        Wes would end up having to move back home with his parents in 2018.
